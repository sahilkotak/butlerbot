## Instructions

- Only `sandbox` Square accounts can be connected
- Square seller account also must have at least one `item` and an active `terminal` device paired to the account required for checking out. If you do not satify these requirements, we have provided you a _ButletBot_ demo account to play with.
- Need to provide microphone permission access for the app to work properly.
- Interaction with the application are purely voice interface driven
- Good to know tips for a better experience over all:
  - Conversation starter example _"Hi. I'd like to order please."_
  - Rather than passing single word instructions, please use sentences. For e.g., _If the bot asks to confirm an order item, then saying something like "Yes, I'd want to add the Cheese Burger please." goes a long way than just saying "Yes."_
  - The application silently drops small enough audio clip conversations to filter out background noise
